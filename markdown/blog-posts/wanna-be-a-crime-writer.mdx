# Wanna Be a Crime Writer?

### NOV 7, 2023

Wanna be a crime writer? Of course you do! I'm having a contest open to all, and here's your chance to be A PUBLISHED AUTHOR!

Write a short story of up to 500 words using ALL of the following terms, and I'll publish my five favorites on my brand new super-duper website.

Here you go: (1) Moonlight Sonata (2) Grand Slam (3) Slinky (4) Chain Saw (5) Turkey

Submit your story by Thanksgiving on my website contact page. This is NOT a competition. (Yes, actually it is.) Feel free to invite family and friends to participate, though that might lower your chances of winning to nil.

Okay, get started. You've got a deadline to meet!
