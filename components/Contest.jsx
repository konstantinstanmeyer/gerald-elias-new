            <p>Remember my Short Story Contest last November? No? Well, never mind.
Here’s a new contest: <strong>Send me a crazy photo of you holding one of my
books.</strong></p>
        <p>That’s it! That’s all you have to do to enter. You can do this.</p>
        <p>
            The five craziest photos (IMHO) will win a FREE Kindle edition of my soon-
            to-be-released (May 2024) collection of short crime fiction, <strong>MURDER ON
            VACATION</strong>, starring everyone’s favorite retired NYPD Police Chief, Maury
            Gross. Never heard of him? You’ll love him.
        </p>
        <p>I’ll also post a whole bunch of the photos on my website. It doesn’t get
much better than that.</p>
        <p>
            If I get more than 100 photos I might hand out more prizes. If I get more
            than 1,000, I’ll retire. Did I hear someone say, “Good riddance?”
        </p>
        <p>DEADLINE, May 1. That’s an easy one to remember. “May Day! May Day!”</p>
        <p>
            To send your crazy photo, you can contact me through my website,&nbsp;
            <a target="_blank" href="www.mysteriesandmusic.com">www.mysteriesandmusic.com</a>, or you can just post on my FB or Instagram
            page, or text me if you’ve got my number, or… Don’t worry. We’ll work it
            out.
