            <p>At the end of January I received an email from the renowned author and environmental activist, <a target="_blank" href="http://terrytempestwilliams.com/">Terry Tempest Williams</a>. It said, in part:</p>

                    Greetings.  I am thinking of you.  I am taking a group of 15 students from the
                    Harvard Divinity School to Great Salt Lake for eight days from March 9 through
                    March 16.  A film is being made by the wonderful filmmaker <a target="_blank" href="https://www.idlewildfilmsinc.com/about">Erika Cohn</a>.  <a target="_blank" href="https://utahfilmcenter.org/people/geralyn-dreyfous/">Geralyn

                    We are meeting with various members of our community about the life of
                    Great Salt Lake from its ecology to the industries to how we might bring water
                    to her to the actual poetry of Great Salt Lake.

                    In my mind and heart, music is key.  Would you have any interest in coming to Great Salt Lake
                    and working with the students, many of them are poets -- Can you imagine putting words with
                    music to give a concert on Antelope Island for Friday, March 15?  I just keep dreaming what we
                    might do to be a Lake-Facing Community at this hour of need for Great Salt Lake -- and how
                    each of us might offer her our gifts.

                    Might you be interested in giving a concert at the Lake?  And how might we work together to
                    create a moment of healing grace for Great Salt Lake -- and these beautiful students.
                    We could also open it to the public.

            <p>
                Terry and I have known each other since the mid-90s, when the Utah composer Phillip <a href="https://bimstein.com/" target="_blank">Bimstein</a>
                composed a work for the Abramyan String Quartet (of which I was the first violinist) plus
                excerpts of Terry reading from her book, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/820924.Refuge"><i>Refuge</i></a>, which were manipulated on computer by
                Phillip. (The composition is called “<a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7engKpS1njDPNEkTyHEB75">Refuge</a>”, by the way, and is available on Spotify and other
                streaming sites.)
            </p>
            <p>
                I hadn’t heard from Terry for a few years, so I was indeed surprised to hear from her, especially
                about the nature of this request.
                Usually, planning a concert takes months of preparation. Obviously, one needs composers,
                music, musicians, instrumental parts, rehearsals, and a place to play! We had none of those. And
                we had six weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I sent out an APB to two of my former friends and colleagues at the University of Utah School of
                Music, <a target="_blank" href="https://music.utah.edu/faculty/miguel-chuaqui.php">Miguel Chuaqui</a> and <a href="https://faculty.utah.edu/u0332214-IGOR_IACHIMCIUC/hm/index.hml" target="_blank">Igor Iachimciuc</a>, who are composers and professors composition.
                (Igor is additionally a player of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimbalom" target="_blank">cimbalom</a>, an exotic Eastern European dulcimer-like
                instrument.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically, my message was the equivalent of throwing everything on the wall and seeing what
                stuck. Could you compose something (essentially overnight) to accompany poems? Could some
                of the students compose music? Could we improvise music to the poems when we were on the
                island with the poets? Could we bring a string quartet to play music about the Great Salt Lake?
                Anything and everything was on the table––or on the wall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over a period of a couple weeks, we honed things down to the following: Igor and I combined
                forces to compose music for a substantial 10-stanza poem called “Dear Great Salt Lake” by
                <a href="https://raisatolchinsky.com/" target="_blank">Raisa Tolchinsky</a>. Since there would essentially be no rehearsal time with Raisa for this, Igor and
                I alternated writing 1-2 minute musical “essays” in between the stanzas, reflecting the sentiment
                and text of what had just been recited. The music was for violin, cimbalom, and flute, played by
                Igor’s talented daughter, Olivia. One day I would email Igor the score of one of my interstitial
                extravaganzas, and the next day he would send me his. We alternated like this over a period of a
                few weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                But one poem does not a program make! As politely as possible, I kept asking Terry for more
                poems. In the meantime, another composer at the U stepped forward. <a href="https://faculty.utah.edu/u0380320-MATTHEW_RUSSELL_DURRANT/hm/index.hml" target="_blank">Matthew Russell Durrant</a>
                had composed a prize-winning piece on computer a few years back entitled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwzeUbzzmes" target="_blank">Arsenic Requiem</a>,”
                about humanity’s destructive incursion into the Great Salt Lake ecosystem over the past two
                centuries. I gave it a listen and an immediate thumbs up. The only problem: We needed to make
                sure we had electricity where we were performing to which to connect the computer and
                amplifiers.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were two possible venues on Antelope Island. One was at the Visitor’s Center at the north
                end of the island. The other was the Garr Ranch near the southern tip. <a href="https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/antelope-island/ranch-tour/" target="_blank">The Garr Ranch</a> was a
                working horse ranch in the 19 th century, but in the 20 th it changed hands a few times and
                ultimately became part of <a href="https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/antelope-island/" target="_blank">Antelope Island State Park</a>, which encompasses the entire island. It is
                now a ranch museum with several small buildings, a small ranch house, and a large, open ended
                barn.
            </p>
            <p>
                It turned out that both of those venues had electricity. I opted for the Garr Ranch because in my
                mind it had the proper rustic feel to support Terry’s vision of nature and preservation. But I
                didn’t know which of the buildings at the ranch would be the most appropriate, partly because
                we had no idea how large an audience we’d have.
            </p>
            <p>
                About two weeks before the concert date, Terry sent me a brief but powerful poem entitled
                “Inseparable” by <a href="https://nanseymour.com/" target="_blank">Nan Seymour</a>, the poet-in-residence on Antelope Island. Miguel immediately
                stepped forward and provided music for solo violin which provided for pauses during which Nan
                would recite lines from her poem. Again, a crafty way to minimize the need for rehearsal!
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point we had three pieces of music. Terry informed us that two of the poets would simply
                recite their poems, and one person would like to sing something. All fine with me. We had
                ourselves a program!
            </p>
            <p>
                We felt that an audience of 50 to 100 would be ideal. At first, we worried we might get too many
                people, so we hardly did any promotion. But as we got closer to March 15, we thought, uh-oh,
                maybe nobody will want to come, especially with the potential for crazy weather that time of
                year. Even though it’s only an hour from downtown Salt Lake City, Antelope Island can be a
                very foreboding place to be if the weather acts up. So, at the end, we started promoting quite
                actively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Which meant that even on the day of the concert, we still had no idea how many people would
                show up!
            </p>
            <p>
                March 15 arrived. My plan was to meet with Terry and the poets a few hours in advance to get to
                know them and to have a somewhat relaxed rehearsal. This is the email I received from Terry the
                morning of the concert:

            </p>
            <p>
                Uh-huh.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got to the Garr Ranch at 1:00 p.m. to look for a place to play a concert. It was sunny and clear,
                but quite chilly and there was a stiff breeze. The first place I looked into was the ranch house.
                Indoors made sense given the weather. There were three available rooms connected by
                doorways. We could play in the middle one and people could look through the doorway if
                necessary, but the rooms were tiny, and if there was a big crowd it would be impossible,
                particularly given our instruments and equipment. There were a few electric outlets, but I didn’t
                know whether they worked or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only other possibility was the barn with a dirt floor. It was large enough for a big crowd, but
                was totally open at both ends, so the chill wind tended to whip through. It did, however, have
                electricity, as evidenced by overhead lights that actually worked, plus a few modern outlets.
            </p>
            <p>
                I managed to find someone in the office tucked away in a corner of one of the outbuildings. He
                informed me that the ranch house electricity had been shut down many years ago. That made
                decision-making a lot easier for me. The barn!
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though it would have been picturesque for the audience to have a view of the lake and the
                Wasatch Mountains beyond if the musicians sat at the eastern end of the barn, we would have
                frozen and our music would have blown off our music stands like leaves in autumn. I managed to
                find a spot in the middle of the barn, against one of the walls, that kept us reasonably protected,
                even though we ended up performing with vests and parkas on.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing that you might have taken for granted by this point was that there would be seats. At
                3:00, an hour before the concert was to start, we had no seats. Terry to the rescue. She had
                arranged for a few dozen chairs (I’m still not sure from whence they came), and she also cajoled
                the ranch office person to haul out dozens more.
            </p>
            <p>
                At about 3:45, with the wind blowing and everyone running around like crazy, doing interviews,
                setting up cameras for filming, schmoozing with old friends, we had our “rehearsal” with the
                poets. Done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just before the concert started I mentioned to Terry that I had written a mystery, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cloudy-Chance-Murder-Jacobus-Mystery/dp/1685120253"><i>Cloudy With a
                Chance of Murder</i></a>, about a (fictitious) concert at the very same Garr Ranch, never in a million
                years thinking that one would or could ever take place. I said to Terry, “I just hope this one
                doesn’t have a murder and a natural disaster.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We had a full house! The concert started on time with speeches and thankyous, including Terry
                mentioning what I had said about my book, which drew a lot of chuckles. The performance went
                smoothly, with the music constantly threatening to blow off our stands, but rarely having the
                nerve to actually carry out its threat. And there weren’t any murders.
            </p>
            <p>
                The poems and the music celebrated the unique wonders of the Great Salt Lake, making us
                mindful of the serious challenges it faces for its survival. Yes, it could dry up in a matter of
                years, regardless of what our politicians tell us, and that would be a disaster of profound
                proportions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concert was also dedicated to the renowned filmmaker, Geralyn Dreyfous, a dear friend to
                us all, who attended the concert though she is encountering serious health issues. We love you,
                Geralyn.

                Here’s a lovely write-up we received in the <a href="https://www.standard.net/news/environment/2024/mar/18/great-salt-lake-inspired-words-music-shared-by-visiting-group-from-harvard/" target="_blank">Ogden Standard Examiner</a>.
