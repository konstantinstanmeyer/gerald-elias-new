The operatic scene is set at the crucial moment when Grandstaff must decide whether to stay and fight for his land or flee to save his life.`

Elias deliberately leaves open whether the narrator is slowly going insane. It's an effective mad scene in the best 19th century operatic tradition, and Eberhardt was quite stunning as she sang and occasionally declaimed the lines of Poe's most famous poem."`

And the result is nothing less than enchanting. With his homage to the 18th-century concerto grosso form, Elias created a work that is refreshingly original and captivatingly melodic. It's a wonderful showcase for the violinist. One can discern stylistic elements from Kreisler and Paganini in the soloist's part, yet at no time in the work, which is played without pause, does Elias slavishly imitate any composer. His musical and harmonic language is manifestly his own. As a composer, Elias certainly has much to say and in a way that is infectious and direct.”`

As an aside, Essie, then in her 97, mostly blind and hard of hearing, attended the premiere. It was the first classical concert she ever went to. Her whole family was there with her. She said she really enjoyed it. She passed away about a year later.`

The piece was every bit as witty as Elias' program notes, in which he told his two sources of inspiration to show 'just how perverse the workings of the human mind can be.' The one movement work was based the 'insulting' noise his printer made in Italy and the 'jingle' signaling a specific Tokyo train stop. The urban-sounding piece had a quality of childlike wonder mixed with good-natured angst. The phrasing and articulation accentuated this mood, the one movement ('Furioso-Adagio-Allegretto-Furioso-Prestlo') was a delight from start to finish.”`

The Overture is tonal, but with captivatingly dissonant harmonies thrown in. Akin to Prokofiev's Classical Symphony in character, Elias' piece is actually much more indebted to Mozart. With its occasional biting harmonic language, lyricism and a generous dose of humor, the score is deceptively straightforward. This could very well have served as the overture to Mozart's 'Marriage of Figaro' or 'Don Giovanni,' but as with the Concerto Grosso, Elias cleverly adds his unique perspective to familiar musical forms. The piece is urbane, stylish and highly entertaining.”`
