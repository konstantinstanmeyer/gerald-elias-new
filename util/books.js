            `Greed, lust, power, and murder are words not commonly associated with the world of classical music. Yet this is the setting into which blind Daniel Jacobus, a reclusive, cantankerous violin teacher living in self-imposed exile in rural New England, is inexorably drawn. For Jacobus, who spends his time chain smoking, listening to old LPs, and berating students in the hope they will flee, the evils of that world are epitomized by the “Piccolino” Stradivarius, a uniquely dazzling violin that has brought misfortune to all who possessed it over the centuries.`,
            `After the Carnegie Hall debut of nine-year old Grimsley Competition winner Kamryn Vander, who is managed by the ruthless Musical Arts Project (MAP), the priceless “Piccolino” is stolen with Jacobus at the scene of the crime.`,
            "But that's not the end of his problems. Haughty Victoria Jablonski, Vander's teacher and Jacobus's rival, is brutally murdered, and Jacobus becomes the primary suspect in both crimes. With the help of his musical partner Nathaniel Williams and his intriguing new student Yumi Shinagawa, Jacobus sets out to rid the world of MAP and prove his innocence against all odds.",

His young African American rival, BTower, is spotted at the scene of the crime hovering over the body of Allard with blood on his hands. In short order the aloof and arrogant BTower is convicted and sentenced to death, in part the result of the testimony of blind and curmudgeonly violin pedagogue Daniel Jacobus. Justice has been served...or has it? Jacobus is dragged back into the case kicking and screaming, and reluctantly follows a trail of broken violins and broken lives as it leads inexorably to the truth, and to his own mortal peril.",

But as the fateful downbeat approaches, a la Agatha Christie, one by one the quartet's musicians mysteriously vanish, including second violinist, Yumi Shinagawa, former student of renowned blind pedagogue and amateur sleuth, Daniel Jacobus. It is left up to the begrudging Jacobus, with his old friend, Nathaniel Williams, and a new member of the detective team, Trotsky the bulldog, to unravel the deadly puzzle.

Sometimes it's hard to even tell if a crime has been committed, as in “Sleeping Beauty,” “The Audition,” or “Prince of the Leafcutters.” Some erudite critics might even bestow upon those particular stories the lofty title of literary fiction.`,
            `Other crime subgenres include hardboiled, rock 'em sock 'em violent crime, as in “Honey Pot,” to the more gently soft-boiled, as in “Elephant Seals.” Or humorous, as in “Buffaloed” and “Brotherhood.” Then there are the Western mysteries, and I've got five of them starring the introspective cowboy, Jefferson Dance. And the amateur sleuth, featuring the irascible Daniel Jacobus, who you either love to hate or hate to love. And police procedurals, featuring retired NYPD Police Chief, Maury Gross. And how could we forget spy stories, here represented by “The Case of the Burqa-ed Busker” and others? There's even one, “A Family Plot,” which is less of a story and more of a puzzle, though a tragic crime has indeed been committed. Let's see if you can figure it out.`,

Blind, sharp-tongued violinist Daniel Jacobus, living in self-imposed exile in rural New England, is drawn into mysterious crimes in New York City. A stolen Stradivarius - a strangled teacher of child prodigies - Jacobus is not only the chief investigator of these misdeeds, he's the prime suspect! A police detective hot on his tail, Jacobus roams the bucolic Berkshires, hallowed Carnegie Hall, and tradition-bound Japan, searching for answers only he can see. With alluring student Yumi and jazz-loving Nathaniel at his side, Jacobus feels his way through self-doubt and darkness.`,

In short order, the aloof and arrogant BTower is convicted and sentenced to death - in part the result of the testimony of blind and curmudgeonly violin pedagogue Daniel Jacobus, who, like millions of others, was an ardent admirer of Allard. Justice has been done... or has it?`,
