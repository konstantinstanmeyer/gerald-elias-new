                over policing in our society, of the seemingly diametrically opposed notions of public safety versus social
                justice.`,
                `Maury Gross, a retired, Jewish NYPD police chief, is a good, respected cop. He’s ethical, honest, thoughtful,
                and considerate even of the perpetrators of the crimes that he solves. He doesn’t look for trouble, but
                trouble seems to find him whenever and wherever his devoted wife Bobbi takes them on what they hope will
                be a relaxing, carefree vacation.`,
                `Maury is a good guy who likes a nice sandwich and watching the Mets on television. That might make him an
                improbable hero in this shades-of-gray day and age, where TV cops seem to gravitate towards being divorced
                alcoholics with fathers suffering from Alzheimer’s and with maturing daughters whose growing-up problems
                are clear as a bell to everyone but somehow not to a trained detective. No thanks. I like my Maury just the
                way he is.`,

                butchered. A human corpse is found nearby. Are the two deaths related? The most likely explanation involves
                the heated conflict between wild horse lovers and cattle interests competing for precious grazing land until
                Dance and his dog, Smoke, discover a fanatical, cult-like caravan community hidden from civilization.`

                `“So, what’s the story on that girl?” Zelensky asked.`,

                Joseph Morton, is her uncle.”`,
                `“Why is she all dressed up?” Zelensky asked. “Kind of fancy
                for the morning isn’t it?”`,
                `“There was a big party last night. Claims she felt faint
                and went out in the garden to get some fresh air and fell
                asleep,” Bronson explained. “Came inside this morning and found
                the body.”`,
                `“Anybody else in the house?” queried Zelensky.`,
                `“Butler and housekeeper are in the kitchen,” Bronson
                answered. “We’ve kept them sequestered there until you could
                interview them.”`,
                `“How was the deceased dressed? Formal or night clothes?”`,
                `“Look for yourself.”`,
                `“No thanks,” Zelensky said quickly.`,
                `“What’s the matter, squeamish?’ Bronson laughed.`,
                `“I might be coming down with something,” Zelensky admitted.`,
                `“Well, why don’t you go interview the staff in the
                kitchen,” Bronson suggested. “Maybe the housekeeper will brew
                you a cup of tea.”`,
                `In the kitchen, Zelensky found a distinguished older
                gentleman and a sour-faced middle-aged woman.`,
                `“It’s about time someone came to interview us,” the woman
                said before Zelensky could say a word. “I need to get back to
                work. This place is a mess since that party last night.”`,
                `“I just have a few questions for both of you,” Zelensky

                crime scene.”`,

                place and cleaned off the blood before the police arrived,” she
                complained. “One less thing for me to clean later.”
                “What?” Zelensky asked, in shock.`,

                Morton on the floor with the chandelier on top of him and that
                stupid player piano was playing Moonlight Sonata. Probably
                passed out from too much booze and the vibration from the piano

                staggered alongside a railroad track, he spotted something on
                the ground. Bending, he grasped the end of a chain, saw a woman
                in a slinky dress secured to a railroad tie at the other end,
                and asked the two obvious questions.`,

                mused, her husband’s gonna get his wish.`,
                `In the moonlight, Sonata looked like a young Jane Russell,
                so when Clint heard the whistle-shriek of the Arizona-bound
                choo-choo, he pocket-fumbled his jigglers out and unlocked the
                handcuffs that held her to the chain.`,

                her into his arms while the locomotive and forty cattle cars
                roared by. Inhaling the Chanel No. 5 fragrance of Sonata’s hair,
                along with a hot, dusty whiff of cow shit, Clint looked over her

                Thanksgiving has always been the day to murder his girlfriend.`,
                `Not that his lovers have been particularly terrible. Some
                were hopeless, sure. But most of them, he concedes, were good
                souls. Tracy knit him an afghan for his sofa. Loretta introduced
                him to shakshuka. Joyce recharged his Honda’s air conditioner.
                That lady was really something. And she rocked those coveralls.`,
                `Commitment is Trevor’s problem. A relationship is fine at
                first, but then she’ll start demanding his time, cluttering up
                his small, neat house, and transferring her perfumy scent to his
                pristine shirts. It’s all too much.`,
                `He tried a traditional breakup, but Trevor dislikes
                confrontation, all that screeching, sobbing, throwing dishware,
                and pouting for days. And the women can be unpleasant about it
                as well.`,

                terrible accident, officer. Rachel caught the grand slam with

                in his bereavement.`,

                window. To that end, as the turkey warms in the oven, he
                suggests that they take in the view upstairs.`,
                `“Let’s have a drink first,” Sydney proposes, unbagging a
                bottle: absinthe, which Trevor has never tasted. She pours a
                couple of shots, adding water and sugar to cushion its notorious
                bite.`,
                `They raise a glass to Thanksgiving and chug. Absinthe is
                strong stuff, he concludes.`,
                `“Again for good luck,” Sydney says, and she prepares more
                shots. Trevor doesn’t mind; he’ll need a bit of luck.`,
                `Soon the room is reeling around him, and he struggles to
                concentrate on the plan. Now Sydney’s reassuring arm guides him
                to the garage and helps him into his Honda’s driver’s seat. Her
                hand closes around his on the ignition key, and the motor roars
                to life.`,
                `On the car radio a pianist deftly works the opening
                arpeggios of the Moonlight Sonata: a tender touch. Trevor can’t
                seem to move. Where’s Sydney, he wonders. She’s over at the
                threshold, finger poised on the garage door button. “Bye,
                Trevor,” she says. “I’m sorry, but I have a hard time with
                breakups. You should know, though, that I’m thankful for the
                time we had together.”`,
                `She vanishes, the door rumbles closed, and Trevor’s
                swimming head nods forward. His eyelids descend slowly, like the
                final curtain in a melodrama. The motor purrs and the air begins
                to thicken, so his breathing is enough to tire him. He really
                should get back to his plan, but what harm can a few minutes’

                longer than anyone else’s 100-foot yacht) and looked out over
                the nighttime Seattle skyline. As always, he wore a polo shirt
                and khaki shorts showing off the massive calves and narrow
                ankles that many assumed had earned him his name--only a few
                people still living knew the real story.`,

                glass, took out his phone, and cued up some music. As befitting
                a yacht of this size and a man of his tastes, the sound system
                could have powered a large club. As the gentle, rolling triplet
                of the C-minor chord started its haunting progression at a
                volume he could feel in his bones, Joe sighed softly and closed
                his eyes. Nothing like Moonlight Sonata on an actually moonlit
                summer evening, drinking thousand-dollar-a-bottle 25 year
                Balvenie on your multi-million-dollar yacht.`,

                club he ran at night. He was in too deep to get out. At least
                his kids didn’t know. He’d kept them in the dark. They were good
                kids; they’d been raised right. Growing up in the South End, he
                and his friend Eddie played baseball, cards, and hooky. He made

                underway. The man had piles of cash in front of him. Stacks of

                `Old Franz Eisich recited their names, one by one, as he passed by their graves on his mower. Sewalls, Pikes, Johns. The Spencers. He knew all the families by heart. The names, and the dates and epitaphs, too. Except for those under slate stones so old that all the writing had worn off long before he ever got there. Or the little ones that only had the initials of the babes who died in their mother’s arms. No one would ever know who they had been, but they were almost like his friends and he felt they knew him, too. And that odd coffin-sized patch of darker green. When his mind wandered, as had been happening more often of late, Franz wondered, is there was someone underneath there, too? And if so, could whoever was hear his mower passing over it?`,
                `Franz had tended the Rockdale graveyard since he was fourteen. Yet in all his many years, he couldn’t remember such intense heat the day after Memorial Day. Still only May and so unseasonably, unreasonably hot. And no breeze, either. They still called it the Rockdale graveyard though the hamlet of Rockdale itself, which preceded the American Revolution, became a ghost town after the train stopped coming through in the ‘30s and then was swallowed up entirely by the forest until no trace of it was left except the graveyard and vanishing memories of the old folks. And soon even those would be gone.`,
                `When the county had originally hired Franz they handed him a push mower and paid him a dollar per. He thought he would only do it for one summer because they felt sorry for him, but they kept on hiring him because he was conscientious about keeping the grass trim and well-manicured all the way up to the stones. And though no one had been buried in the graveyard since 1956, the county had wanted the little cemetery surrounded by the encroaching woods to look tidy because it was visible from the road. When times became flush, the county provided him with a John Deere rider mower, and at the end they were paying him thirty-five dollars per mowing, which, at that point in his simple life, was sufficient. But after twenty-eight years the county decided that spending money to maintain the Rockdale graveyard was a frill. Nevertheless, Franz continued to tend it on his own accord. Descendants of the deceased had a right to see the graves of their ancestors properly cared for, he thought, and as the county had by that time long forgotten about the mower, it was no problem.`,
                `Because grass grows faster in a graveyard, Franz always made it a point to mow it within a few days of Memorial Day because he wanted it to look nice on the one day in the whole year that more than the curious passer-by would pay a visit.  Descendants, friends, and those who simply remembered left things: flowers, little American flags, pinwheels, balloons. Even dolls and other trinkets. For as long as he could remember, the grave of little Ashton Spencer, 1846-1849, always had a bowl of plums gracing it on Memorial Day weekend, which Franz found very curious.`,
                `Since he usually mowed the lawn only one, two, or at most three days before Memorial Day, Franz didn’t need to get back to the graveyard until a week later, by which time the bouquets had wilted. He would collect them and the gifts, and because none were worth anything, threw them all out. The plums, though, were always gone by the time he returned, and he often wondered who would be so callous to steal something like that.`,
                `This past week, Franz had needed to revise his traditional schedule because of his eyes. They were going bad. His son, Eric, had arranged an appointment with a specialist in Pittsfield to do tests on Wednesday. They told him he’d have to stay out of the light for a few days after. His granddaughter, Josie, was going to drive him there, showing off with her new driver’s license, because he didn’t drive. The John Deere was the only vehicle they decided was safe enough for him to sit behind the wheel in. Not that that was much of a consolation prize. The darn thing was getting harder and harder to start, and the engine was making a heck of a racket. Franz made sure to fill the tank with gasoline because once he got it started he sure as heck wasn’t going to turn it off until it was back in his barn.`,
                `So on the day after Memorial Day, Franz circled the half-dead oak tree in the center of the Rockdale graveyard. Before ’78—or was it ’79—when the tornado blew through and lightning struck the tree, which until then had been sort of a natural sundial, casting a circulating shadow over all the graves over the course of the day. The tornado’s path had left a flattened truck stop down the road and teased the edge of the graveyard. No one had been killed, but folks at the truck stop, having barely evaded death, joked that if they had died at least the graveyard would’ve been in good shape. A few headstones had been knocked over, which Franz subsequently reset with great care, but that was the extent of the damage. The oak, which might well have been even older than the graveyard itself, had been split right down the middle, and the shadow it cast no longer kept good time. One half of it died, though it’s charred skeleton stubbornly refused to surrender to gravity. The other half acted as if nothing had happened. In the dead of winter the two halves couldn’t be told apart, but now the live half, its pale green spring foliage, tender and vulnerable, provided the graveyard’s only shade.`,
                `Franz chose that cool spot under the living half to pull the brake on his mower.  The little sunlight sneaking through the leaves painted a mask of dappled light on his face. He wiped his face with his handkerchief, removing the sweat but not the shadows. He had brought a canteen of water with him, but as his labor was almost complete, he decided that he would wait to quench his thirst.`,
                `A pair of puppies bounded out of the woods, puffballs of brown-black fur with not a care in the world, chasing tails and rolling each other over. Newfoundlands. Franz had had many a dog in his day, but never a Newfie. Only mutts. Or mixed breeds, Franz thought, as they call mutts today. Smarter and healthier than purebreds, mutts are. Better companions than people.`,
                `The pups ambled around the graveyard, sniffing as they went, ending their expedition at little Ashton Spencer’s headstone, where they ravenously began to devour the bowl of plums.`,
                `Mystery solved! Franz got off the mower to move in for a closer look, his eyesight being so poor. He left the engine running, though. He wasn’t going to take any chances of not being able to restart it. The pups, intent on enjoying their snack, paid him no heed as he approached. If only the folks who had brought the plums knew where their devotional gift was going! Should he tell them?`,
                `He was right behind the pups now, and bent over to gently shush them away.`,
                `He squinted. They weren’t puppies. They weren’t dogs at all.`,
                `Suddenly enshrouded by an unlikely shadow, Franz looked over his shoulder. An explosive blow to his forehead drove Franz to the ground. He was dazed and his head throbbed. His cheek pressing against the cool and moist dark patch of green he had just mown, Franz felt his hot blood begin to drip around his ears and mix with fresh, sweet-smelling grass clippings. He groaned and agonizingly rolled onto his back.`,
                `A mother bear, standing on its hind legs, was over six feet tall, her shadow enveloping Franz. He had seen bears before. Black bears. There had been more and more sightings of them recently—even reports of them breaking into houses and rifling through refrigerators—but no one had ever been attacked by one. At least to his knowledge.`,
                `A painful glow from the setting sun, stinging his failing eyes, formed a pulsating, read halo around the bear. What was it they say you’re supposed to do if you’re confronted by a bear? Franz tried to remember. Stand up tall and make yourself look big, or roll into a fetal ball and play dead? Be silent, or yell in a high voice? Slowly back away, or run like heck? One thing he was sure of. Never get between a mother and its cubs.`,
                `His friend Joe always carried a long stick with him just in case, to hold over his head to make himself look taller because he said bears have bad eyesight. A funny thought popped into Franz’s head that the bear should go with him to the specialist in Pittsfield.`,
                `If he could make it to the John Deere, maybe he could escape. Thank God he had left it running. Franz propped himself up on his elbows.`,
                `“Mama,” Franz said. “I mean you and your pups no harm.”`,
                `The bear hovered over him.`,
                `“You hear? This ain’t my time. I still got work to do.”`,
                `The bear carried the stench of carrion and made Franz want to vomit. The two cubs, having finished their plums, approached Franz warily. Deciding he was a new adventure, they pounced on his stiffening legs and tore on the cuffs of his overalls. Franz, dizzy, remained motionless, eyes fixed on the mother, willing it to understand. The bear raised its forearm and extended its clawed paw.`,
                `No one in memory had been killed by a black bear.`,
                `The cubs continued to tug playfully on Franz’s pant leg. As his mind hovered on the edge of consciousness, memories of his German mother long ago resurfaced. He hadn’t thought about her for such a long time.`,
                `A slight breeze rustled the leaves of the old, lightning-blasted oak and stirred the little flags and pinwheels on the graves.`,
                `The gentle tone of the bear’s voice surprised Franz.`,
                `“Gib deine Hand, du schön und zart Gebild!`,
                `Bin Freund, und komme nicht, zu strafen.`,
                `What did it mean? Franz wondered. It sounded like an epitaph.`,
                `Sei gutes Muts! ich bin nicht wild,`,
                `Sollst sanft in meinen Armen schlafen!”`,
                `Soon, the only sound in the Rockdale graveyard was the John Deere engine, and when the fuel was all spent, that, too, went silent, and the grass grew over the gravestones.`,

                `I consider myself extremely fortunate. I’ve just released a self-published collection of 30 short mysteries entitled IT’S A CRIME! I’ve written a mystery series of eight books featuring the iconoclastic sleuth, Daniel Jacobus; two stand-alone mysteries, ROUNDTREE DAYS and THE BEETHOVEN SEQUENCE; a musical memoir called SYMPHONIES & SCORPIONS; a children’s book, MAESTRO, THE POTBELLIED PIG; and many more published short stories and essays. And all that in 14 years. I’m probably leaving some things out. Oh, yes. I have another collection of short stories featuring a very empathetic protagonist, a retired NYPD Police Chief named Maury Gross. The name of the collection is MURDER ON VACATION, and I’m in search of a publisher. Let me know if you’d like to be it. They’re terrific stories, if I do say so myself.`,
                `So, what’s troubling me? I’ll tell you. It’s that with all these books, I now spend more time trying to promote (i.e. sell) them than I do writing. Email blasts, Facebook posts, Instagram photos, Amazon promotions, attending Zoom meetings of author organizations, doing events at bookstores, meeting with book clubs – that’s what I do.`,
                `But when I speak to other authors, I realize I’ve just scratched the surface. There’s so much more that can be done. In just the past few days, one author told me how she is able to get customers to buy books directly from her website. Another author told me “how easy it is” to create audiobooks on Audible without having to pay any upfront money. But, isn’t it true that there are still only 24 hours in the day?`,
                `In the old days, or so I’m told, the publisher was the driving force in the marketing of its books, but these ain’t the old days. These days, authors need to be social media experts to make a living. Try as I might, I haven’t developed the knack, perhaps because I really don’t like it. Thank God, I don’t have to rely on book sales to get by, because royalties and 50¢ (okay, $3.00) will get you a cup of coffee.`,
                `Maybe it’s that I still have one foot in the 20th century. Maybe it’s that I’m 70. Or maybe it’s that I’ve just run out of good ideas, because it’s getting harder and harder to start – let alone finish – anything new. On the other hand, I know from speaking with authors who write better than I do how hard and frustrating it is for them to even get through the door to get one book published. Every once in a while, I’ll read one of my earlier books, come across a line I had forgotten I had written, and think, “Hey, that’s pretty good.” So, I can’t complain…but I guess I just did.`,

                `Go to England or Israel with a shovel and start digging, and pretty soon you’re likely to unearth a bit of history or prehistory. Chances are it will be a mere bauble or broken potsherd, but if you’re lucky you’ll strike it rich, discovering an entire Roman mosaic or an Old Testament scroll.`,
                `I’ve been that lucky, because the same, in a sense, is true for Baroque music repertoire. Even with the hundreds of composers we know of and their thousands of compositions, we’ve hardly scratched the surface. Less than a hundred years ago, for example, the gold mine named Antonio Vivaldi was virtually unknown. And the more we dig, the more we uncover. It’s as if the reservoirs of music are as unlimited as the earth’s vast stores of oil, and are much more environmentally friendly.`,
                `Several years ago, I was researching repertoire for the annual Vivaldi by Candlelight chamber orchestra concert that I conduct, seeking “new” music by tapping into that bottomless reserve of Baroque repertoire. I stumbled across a composer I’d never heard of, Pietro Castrucci. A YouTube performance of six concerti grossi he had composed immediately grabbed my attention: They were dramatic, expressive, dynamic, and most impressively, his was a unique voice, distinct from his more illustrious contemporaries, Handel, Corelli, Vivaldi, and Bach.`,
                `I immediately added his music on the program. But, in addition, as a violinist I’m always trying to expand my own repertoire to perform in recital. I was delighted to discover that Castrucci also composed 12 violin sonatas as his opus 1. To my chagrin, I was not only unable to find a recording of more than one or two of them (though a few had been transcribed for flute), the only print edition of his sonatas was the original one from 1718!`,
                `The more I learned about Castrucci, the more I felt a kinship. His music will never see the kind of revival that Vivaldi’s had, not that it is in any way inferior, but because he composed so little of it. And the reason? He had a day job. In 1715, he and his brother Prospero were recruited to go to London from their homes in Italy in order to become the concertmaster and principal second violinist, respectively, of an opera company orchestra that had been created expressly for Handel. Pietro remained in that position for twenty years, and in that period he only had time to compose two sets of violin sonatas and the one set of twelve concerti grossi referenced above. As a full-time orchestra player myself for 36 years–and for most of that time an associate concertmaster–I felt like I knew this guy: practicing new repertoire every week, going to endless rehearsals, late night performances, and fitting in recitals and compositions when time (and energy) permitted.`,
                `If I ever needed a mission in life, I now had one. This man’s music needed to be heard. To make a long story very, very short, I’ve made the first recording in history of the entire opus 1 by Pietro Castrucci, in collaboration with harpsichordist Pamela Palmer-Jones and cellist Noriko Kishi. These sonatas are fantastic, traversing as wide an expressive spectrum as one could hope for, from darkly turbulent to light-as-a-feather charming. The 18th-century music historian, Charles Burney wrote, “[Castrucci] was long thought insane…his compositions were too mad for his own age.” They might not seem as insane to us today, but they remain as fresh distinctive as on the day they were composed. The recording will be released by Centaur Records on April 1.`,
                `To “launch” the recording, my colleagues and I are presenting a free lecture and performance at the University of Utah School of Music on Friday, April 22. If you can make it, you’ll experience buried treasure that’s been hidden for 300 years.`,
