The Abramyan Sting Quartet can be heard on CRI, Centaur, Tantarus, Off The Record, and Albany labels. I include just a few reviews we received over the years:`,

And together, these five musicians gave an exceptionally dynamic and electrifying performance of Schumann's great Piano Quintet in E flat major, op. 44. Their interpretation was passionate, refreshingly bold, and yet full of subtle nuances that gave the music depth and a dramatic and distinctively unique personality. It would be difficult indeed to find an interpretation of the Schumann quintet that could surpass this emotionally charged and vivid performance.”`,

Violinist Ronan Lefkowitz and I paired up for several years to form the vaunted Elias/Lefkowitz Duo which performed regularly at Boston's Institute for Contemporary Art. Among our greatest feats was a three-concert series including all 44 Bartok duos. I've also had the pleasure of performing as a free-lance chamber musician in series such as Nova, New Music Ensemble, and Canyonlands in Salt Lake City, Collage in Boston, and the Moab Music Festival. For three years (1989-91) between Thanksgiving and Christmas, my wife, Cecily, and I organized, hosted, and performed in a dozen chamber music concerts in our home, the proceeds of which went to the Salt Lake City Homeless Shelter.`
