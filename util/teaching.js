    `Gerald Elias has had a long career both in the United States and abroad as a violin teacher, chamber music coach, and leader of master classes.`,
    `While a member of the Boston Symphony in the 1970s and '80s, he was on the faculty of the Boston University Tanglewood Institute (BUTI). In recent years he has returned to BUTI to lead masterclasses there, and in 2019 conducted the string students in their first-ever program of Baroque music.`,
    `From 1989 until 2021, when he departed Salt Lake City for Seattle, Elias was on the string faculty of the University of Utah School of Music, in addition to teaching his private studio of advanced students.`,
    `In 1986-87, while on a year-long concert tour during a sabbatical leave from his position as associate concertmaster of the Utah Symphony, Elias was a visiting guest professor at the Musashino Academia Musicae in Tokyo, the University of Canterbury in Christchurch (New Zealand), and the Queensland Conservatorium of Music in Innisfail (Australia).`,
    `From 2004-2012, while on concert tours to Peru and in coordination with the U.S. State Department and local Peruvian arts organizations, Elias gave masterclasses at a number of music schools throughout the country, including teaching as a Fulbright Senior Specialist at the National Conservatory of Peru in 2008.`,
    `Many of Elias's students have gone on to rewarding careers as professional musicians and teachers. But even those who chose other fields have taken with them his requirements of discipline, organization, creativity, imagination, and dedication to high standards in order to find success in whatever other field they chose. And, of course, a love of music.`
